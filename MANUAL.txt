This is the manual for PizzaTAS, this manual will explain how to set it up as well as how to use it

== INSTALLATION ==
You can use Pizza Oven to install it using the mod browser

Otherwise, heres how to install it manually:
- Get an XDelta Patcher (such as Delta Patcher or XDelta3 GUI)
- Download PizzaTAS.zip from either the gamebanana page or the releases page
- Extract it and put tastool.xdelta somewhere nice
- Open your XDelta Patcher
- Navigate to your Pizza Tower instalation folder (on steam you can find this by right clicking the game on your library and clicking "Manage Files")
- Select the data.win file as the original file and the tastool.xdelta file as the patch
- If you get an error after this step, your game is either already modded or not the right version

== CONFIGURATION ==
you'll need to download tasconfig.ini from the same place you downloaded it from, then navigate to your PizzaTower_GM2 folder (on windows, you can find this folder by pressing Win+R, typing %appdata%, then navigating to it) and just drop it in, then open up tasconfig.ini with any text editor (such as notepad) and change the settings as needed

== USAGE ==
PizzaTAS is best used along with LibTAS because of the dedicated TASing tools it provides (such as savestates, rewinding, and much more).
Currently, PizzaTAS serves as a way to easily get information about the game state (such as speed, x and y coordinates, etc) to make TASing easier and as a way to record your inputs and play them back ingame with audio (libTAS requires a linux port of pizza tower which doesnt support audio)

Guide on how to set up libTAS on windows: https://clementgallet.github.io/libTAS/guides/wsl/

== STATS ==
Here are some descriptions for the stats:
- X: Your x coordinate
- Y: Your y coordinate
- dX: The difference between your previous x and your current x position (useful for seeing how fast youre going)
- dY: The difference between your previous y and your current y position (useful for seeing how fast youre going)
- hsp: Your horizontal velocity
- vsp: Your vertical velocity
- hdiff: The difference between your previous hsp and your current hsp
- vdiff: The difference between your previous vsp and your current vsp

- jump: Whether you can currently jump, also shows your coyote time
- grounded: Whether you are currently in the ground
- sprite: Your current sprite, also shows the frame the sprite is in
- state: Your current state

- Room name and target door, which appear on the top left
- Lag meter, which appears during a freeze frame

Theres also three extra timers, one for the time youve spent on the current room, and one for the time you spent on the previous room, and a green one that shows your room time when you entered a screen transition

== KEYBINDNGS ==
Below is a list of the function keys, you can rebind these in tasconfig.ini

Pause: P
Frame advance: F (has some visual glitches, such as frames being delayed by 1 frame on the screen)

Save tas: F6

Toggle unbound camera: F7 (which makes the camera able to see past the room boundaries and doesnt freeze during pause abuse)
Toggle collision drawing: F1
Toggle stats: F2
Toggle bounding boxes: F3
Show everything: F4 (makes everything visible, note that this may affect gameplay, so use with caution)

Add watch: F8 (watches are explained in the next section)

== WATCHES ==
Watches allow you to see the value of any variable in the game through the overlay in the same way the stats do
To add a watch ingame, press the Add watch key (default is F8), this will bring up a series of prompts that will help you setup a watch

First, you will be asked for the name of the watch, this can be whatever you want
Next, you will be asked for the object to get the variable from, this needs to be a valid object, otherwise the watch will display as ???
Some examples are:
- obj_player (the player, duh)
- global (lets you access any global variable, such as laps)

Finally, you will be asked for the name of the variable, the variable must be accesible from the object, otherwise it will display as ???
Some examples are:
- railmovespeed (from obj_player)
- hitlag (from obj_player)
- laps (from global)

If you want to remove a watch, youll have to edit tasconfig.ini directly, info about the formattion can be found in it
